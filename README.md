NFTHUB Arthouse
Welcome to the NFTHUB Arthouse, a project that allows artists to showcase their NFT artwork on the Celo blockchain.

What are NFTs?
NFTs are unique digital assets that are verified on a blockchain, making them one-of-a-kind and impossible to replicate. These tokens can represent anything from artwork to music to tweets.

How it works
The NFTHUB Arthouse allows artists to upload their NFT artwork to the platform, where it can be viewed by interested collectors. The Arthouse focuses on the exhibition of NFTs and does not provide a selling feature. However, it provides a great opportunity for artists to gain exposure and reach a wider audience.
